# uiRetrieval
uiRetrieval parses and breaks down Vue components before vectorizing them. It's able to understand the hierarchy and context of subparts within the component. uiRetrieval provides a semantic search on the vector embeddings to allow for a natural language lookup of UI elements. Helps with creating and automating internal UI libraries.
